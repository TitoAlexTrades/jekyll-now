I will be using this platform to keep track of my trade ideas. Winning and losing trades will also be included. The forex market is constantly moving and evolving, and if you're unable to adapt to different market conditions you will never be prepared. Backtesting and rewiewing your trades (wins and losses) will help benefit your trading decisions once market is live, and being prepared means identifying a good trade setup and executing!
